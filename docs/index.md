# Introduction

I am Abhinav {More Precisely Kumar Abhinav}.

I am not good at anything.

I am a student of ITB2 Information Technology Branch 3rd year.

## Why I am here?

## Are you Exited to see Demo?

### Neural Nettwork

#### CNNs

#### SNNs

Machine learning is a field of study where computers are trained to learn patterns in data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, a machine learning algorithm can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks, which are modeled after the structure of the human brain, to learn from data. Deep learning algorithms are capable of learning and recognizing complex patterns in data.

Now, let's take a look at the code you provided. This code is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library to read in two images from file paths. The images are then displayed using the Matplotlib library. After that, the DeepFace library is used to verify if the two images are the same or different.

To run this code, you need to make sure that you have installed the required libraries: OpenCV, Matplotlib, and DeepFace. You can install them using pip, which is a package manager for Python.

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the code by calling the verify function and passing in the file paths for the two images you want to compare. The function will display the images and then output whether they are the same or different.

In summary, this code is using machine learning and deep learning techniques to verify whether two images are the same or different. It is a simple example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems.
